        <div class="five">It's almost a year since my first time learning about programming and how to become a programmer. I
            learned a lot of how the electronic devices work, how human uses different kind of languages to make websites and games. 
            As a programmer, I now know how to read and write the algorithms, the website with my most basic knowledge. Also, 
            programming allows me to make groups to exchange ideas and help each other out. I can tell where and why my classmates' code have 
            their bug and finding a shorter way to write the code. There are many parts that involve to the creativity that I'm lacking 
            such as having my own way of writing code, making up my plan for better directions and ideas of website decoration.  
            In the end, I'm still want to develop my skills in programming and I'll keep doing it.</div>

            <h3> Reflection</h3>
            In this 1 year of learning Computer Science, I've able to self-study, which is something that I've never
            done before. It was difficult to do but luckily I have lots of helps in school and at home so I can keep up
            with this subject. I learned to have more responsibility with myself in study and think more, process more thing.
            I've got better in researching for information. The reason why I said I got better at that is because
            I usually do researching only for my assignment so I was very carelessly in doing that and got bias information a lot.
            However, when I do it for myself, I've got more carefull, know to check for reliable information and having faster research.
            Learning Computer Science this year is not just learning about computing devices and how to code for me but also
            learn how to study for the benefit of myslef.

            <p>This is the clock project. It is my very first project when I started to code. 
            It is a simple analog clock that will follow the current time. 
            I mainly learned how to decorate by using css through this project.

        <div class="eleven"><a class="aeleven" href="final project/html/tictactoe.html" target="_blank">
            <p>This is my second project. It is a game and its name is tic tac toe.
            This is the game that players would be either X or O and mark down who got 3 Xs or Os first, depend on that player,
            and win the game. 
            This game has 3 options for playing, win 1 times, 3 times or 5 times. 
            From this project, I leanred a lot more of how to use JavaScript.

        <div class="twelve"><a class="atwelve"href="final project/html/pong.html" target="_blank">
            <p>This is the third project. 
            Similar to the tic tac toe game, this is also a game called pong.
            In this game, player can either choose 1 player or play with another player.
            In 2 players mode, who get 100 points first will win.
            In solo mode, player needs to earn 50 points before they lost 3 times (when the ball goes through the paddle and hit 
            the bottom box, player will be count have lost 1 time).
