 # Final Portfolio Project

## About Me

Hi! My name is **Duc V.**, and I’m a student developer passionate about learning the fundamentals of computer science and programming. During my first year of AP CS, I explored the foundations of Java, problem-solving strategies, and how to break down complex challenges into manageable pieces of code.

## About the Project

This is my final portfolio project for AP CS. It showcases the skills and knowledge I gained throughout the year. From understanding object-oriented programming to creating interactive front-end applications, this project represents my growth as a developer and a student.

## What the Portfolio Includes

My portfolio site presents an overview of my work, reflecting the key concepts and tools I learned during the course. It includes a clean, organized layout featuring project descriptions, code samples, and links to live demos or repositories. The site is designed for ease of navigation, making it simple for anyone to browse through my projects and get a sense of what I’ve built.

## Featured Projects

Here are the main projects featured in my portfolio:

- **Flappy Bird Clone**: A JavaScript-based version of the classic Flappy Bird game using HTML5 Canvas. It demonstrates my understanding of game loops, collision detection, and user input handling.
- **Tic Tac Toe Game**: A two-player browser game made with JavaScript. It includes turn-based logic, win condition checks, and a simple UI.
- **Clock App**: A functional clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows the real time and represents as an analog clock.
